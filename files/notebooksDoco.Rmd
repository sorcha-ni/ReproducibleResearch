<!-- Got any organisation information on where researchers can save documentation or notes on their research? This could be eLabNotebooks, documentation platforms/wikis etc? Even google docs or onedrive can be good to point out.  Include it below. 

This information will appear in the section "How to start documenting" on https://amandamiotto.github.io/ReproducibleResearch/instructor/step4Doco.html
